INSTALLATION:

Run Winzip and unzip kitkat_klub.zip into your Half-Life folder.  There will then be a folder in your Half-Life main folder called kitkat_klub.  Make a folder in your Half-Life/Valve folder and name it sound.  Then make a folder inside that folder and name it kitkat_klub.  Place all the wav files mentioned above into that kitkat_klub folder.  Then place the kitkat_klub.bsp in your Half-Life/Valve/Maps folder.  You'll also need to unzip the 10 city2 skies into your Half-Life/Valve/gfx/env folder.

PLAYLEVEL NOTES:

This map is funner if you turn monsters on while you play it.  To do this, type mp_allowmonsters 1 into the console of Half-Life while playing this map.  Then, changelevel to this map again and monsters will be in the map.  

Also, you can do the same trick in several other DocRock maps.  MONSTER_BUNKER SHOULD BE RUN WITH MONSTERS ENABLED FOR A TRULY MONSTROUS BATTLE.
